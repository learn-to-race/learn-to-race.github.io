Season Beta’s racing events will add new features throughout the championship including the integration of the Roborace Metaverse, a mixed reality world within the competition to further challenge teams.

Season Beta will update Roborace’s autonomous overtaking algorithms with ground-breaking technology. Due to safety restrictions, the twelve races hosted over six events will be closed to the public, but the races will all be covered via livestream so that Roborace’s global audience won’t miss any of the action.
