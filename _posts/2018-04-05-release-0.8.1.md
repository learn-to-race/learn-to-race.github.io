We are releasing a quick fix of some of the [issues reported][issueslink], thank
you guys for quickly spotting our mistakes ;)

[issueslink]: https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues

{% include release_button.html release_tag="0.8.1" %}

In this release, @felipecode also slipped a new Python script in for easily
visualizing the start positions of the player vehicle,
`view_start_positions.py`. It displays each start position in the map together
with its index. This is the index that is passed to the simulator for choosing a
particular start position. The script connects to a CARLA simulator instance and
retrieves the start positions of the current map.

You can also use it to display only a set of positions by specifying the list of
indices in the command line with `./view_start_positions.py -pos 10,11,12`.
