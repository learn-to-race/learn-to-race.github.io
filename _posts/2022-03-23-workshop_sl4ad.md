The <i>1st Workshop on Safe Learning for Autonomous Driving</i> (SL4AD) is co-located with the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2022), to be held on 22 July 2022 in hybrid format. Learn-to-Race will be featured as a challenge in this workshop.

We envision this workshop bringing together researchers and industry practitioners from different AI subfields to work towards safer and more robust autonomous technology. We encourage participants to take part in the Challenge by competing for top leaderboard positions, to submit articles for review, and to engage with us at ICML 2022.
