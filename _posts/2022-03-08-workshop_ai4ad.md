We are happy to announce that our workshop proposal, Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Driving (AI4AD), has been accepted to the 31st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the 25th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-ECAI 2022). Learn-to-Race will be featured as a challenge in this workshop.

We envision this workshop bringing together researchers and industry practitioners from different AI subfields to work towards safer and more robust autonomous technology. We encourage participants to take part in the Challenge by competing for top leaderboard positions, to submit articles for review, and to engage with us at IJCAI 2022.
