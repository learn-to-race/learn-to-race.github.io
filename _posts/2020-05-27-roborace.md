Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is joining the upcoming season of Roborace.

CMU’s Roborace team will be a collaborative effort involving multiple departments within Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science. The first U.S.-based team to join the series, Carnegie Mellon University was recently named the top-ranked Artificial Intelligence program in the country by U.S. News & World Report.

Honda Research & Development is supporting the 2021 Masters in Computational Data Science capstone research team and their efforts to bring the next generation of autonomous racing agents to the race track.
