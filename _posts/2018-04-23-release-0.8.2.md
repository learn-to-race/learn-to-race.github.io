We release the new **CARLA 0.8.2**, presenting a
new redefined **driving benchmark** and releasing an agent trained with [**reinforcement learning**](https://github.com/carla-simulator/reinforcement-learning).
The benchmark allows to easily compare autonomous driving algorithms on sets of strictly defined goal-directed navigation tasks.
As a starting point,
we provide the task suite studied in our CoRL-2017 paper, as well
as agents trained with [conditional imitation learning](https://github.com/carla-simulator/imitation-learning)
and [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/carla-simulator/reinforcement-learning). Get CARLA 0.8.2 and try to [beat our driving agents](#can-you-beat-our-agents-)!

[//]: <>(One of the main burdens for one specific science or technology to evolve is having consistent way to compare what the scientists propose. Progress seems to happen when there is a clear, well defined and reproducible problem to tackle.)

[//]: <>(In computer vision, for instance, the Image-Net Dataset helped the unveiling of deep learning and CNNs as a ground breaking technology. This raised image recognition to unimaginable level when compared to just few years ago.)

[//]: <>(For autonomous driving, standard ways to compare methods is scarce, since every company investing)
[//]: <>(real money on this matter seems to have their own data, private simulators and cars. This material, is of course, not accessible to the general public. How could then the autonomous driving community compare their agents ?)

Reproducible research on autonomous driving is complicated by the lack of open tools for rigorous benchmarking. With this CARLA release, we take a step towards providing such a standard testing environment. We release a convenient interface for defining suites of tasks and autonomous agents.

[//]: The CARLA team is working to provide a standard way to compare a autonomous driving algorithms. For now we present the driving benchmark module that allows users to create sets of experiment and assess the driving quality of an agent.

[//]: <>(On this release we already provide the driving benchmark for CoRL2017 and show updated results for the Reinforcement Learning Method and the Imitation Learning Method. We also discuss the reproducibility of CARLA results, i.e, how)

The CARLA 0.8.2 release also adds few other improvements and fixes

* Rolled back vehicle's location to the pivot of the mesh instead of the
  center of the bounding box, this fixes various bugs due to the vehicle's
  position not being always coherent. Now we send too the relative transform
  of the bounding box which in turn also increases the flexibility in which
  new vehicles can be incorporated.
* Added a _frame number_ field to each sensor measurement, this allows
  synchronization between all the measurements based on the frame they are
  produced. The _frame number_ steadily increases each frame and it's not
  reset on each new episode.
* Walkers use now a closer angle to detect vehicles, so they don't stop moving
  if a car passes nearby.
* Improved how vehicles are spawned to better handle spawning failures.
* Fixed lighting artefact causing the road to change its brightness depending
  on the distance to the camera. This was especially noticeable in _Town02_.
* Fixed captured images overexposed in _Low_ mode.
* Fixed illegal character in asset name.
* Fixed editing sun azimuth angle in CarlaWeadther.ini had no effect.
* Fixed crash when using a non-standard image size in DirectX (Windows).

#### Driving benchmark overview

![benchmark diagram](/img/posts/2018-04-15/benchmark_diagram_small.png)

> Figure 1: Overview of the driving benchmark module, agents and new experiment suites (tasks) could easily be placed on the driving benchmark.

The driving benchmark provides a convenient python interface for testing driving _agents_ on _experiment suites_ (Figure 1).
You can either make use of our pre-implemented agents and experiment suites, or develop your own.

Defining a new agent boils down to implementing a single function that takes current observations as input and outputs a control signal.
The interface is agnostic to the type of agent: reinforcement learning, imitation learning, classical modular pipeline, etc.
We currently provide two agents: trained with conditional imitation learning and with reinforcement learning.

We encourage everyone to use our CoRL-2017 tasks, but you can also easily create your own task suites to challenge your agent.
The task suite definition includes the number of navigation trials, starting locations and end goals, types and properties of observations available to the agent, as well as environment properties such as the weather and the number of pedestrians and vehicles.
Further information can be found at the [driving benchmark documentation](https://github.com/carla-simulator/driving-benchmarks), where you can
[get started](https://github.com/carla-simulator/driving-benchmarks) by checking out a simple example.

#### Results

We use the new driving benchmark to re-evaluate agents from our [CoRL-2017 paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v78/dosovitskiy17a/dosovitskiy17a.pdf).
We evaluate two deep-learning-based agents:

* Reinforcement Learning, trained with A3C over 12 days of in-simulation experience.
* Conditional Imitation Learning, trained with 14 hours of expert demonstrations.

The experiment suite includes four tasks of increasing difficulty:

* Straight: the goal is straight ahead of the starting position.
* One turn: getting to the goal takes one turn, left or right.
* Navigation: navigation with an arbitrary number of turns.
* Navigation with dynamic obstacles: same as previous task, but with other vehicles and pedestrians.

As our main quantitative metric, we use the success rate - the percentage of episodes where the agent is able to reach the goal.
To get more consistent results, we ran the benchmark three times (unfortunately, there is a small random difference between different runs, see [details below](#randomness-in-carla)).

We report the mean and the standard deviation over three runs in Tables 1 and 2.
The results are very close to those reported in the CoRL-2017 paper, but do not always match exactly. These small discrepancies are due to randomness in evaluation and minor difference in texture appearance compared to the earlier version of CARLA used in the CoRL-2017 paper.

We additionally show the average number of kilometers travelled without making an infraction.
Same as for success rate, we compute the mean and the standard deviation between three runs.
Same as in our CoRL-2017 paper, infractions are only computed on the fourth task - "Navigation with dynamic obstacles".

#### Randomness in CARLA

As we can see from the result tables, there is a non-zero amount of variation in the results when running the driving benchmark multiple times.
We have put effort into making the experiments as reproducible as possible, yet, there are two known sources of non-determinism:

* **Different load time for textures**: In Unreal Engine, loading time of textures is not completely deterministic, which leads to minor appearance differences.
* **Pedestrians algorithms are non-deterministic** (See [#258](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/258) ).

To give a clearer insight, in the following video we compare the frames of two different runs
in the same machine and with the same random seeds. The CARLA autopilot was used to drive the car.
The pixels in red show when there is a difference between the images from the two runs.

</div>

As we can see, until time 0:20 there are no many differences,
except in few positions. These differences are explained by different loading texture time.
After, at the time 0:20, there is a pedestrian crashing into another.
This crash already changes the course of the simulation, since it caused
an extra wait for the agent.

CARLA experiments are reproducible, but not entirely deterministic.
This explains small variation between runs of the benchmark.
Luckily, in our experiments we found that the variance between runs is generally not extremely large.
We will be working on improving the determinism of CARLA in the future.
